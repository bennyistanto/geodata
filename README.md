# Data Repository

Data and information play an important role in decision making. Furthermore I specifically talk about the geographical data related to place and position on the earth. In spite of the limited availability of geographical data in the internet, this data is considerably important for visualisation, planning and decision support system in all administrative level in Indonesia. 

The data are compiled from various sources, especially Indonesia Geoportal node and categorized into Boundaries (bnd), Climate (cli), Hydrographic (hyd), Natural Hazards (nhr), Physical (phy), Point of Interests (poi), Settlements (pop), Transportation (trs) and Utilities (uti). Also there are numeric data categorized into Tabular data and Others.

Vector data comes in GeoJSON and ESRI shapefile format, raster data comes in TIFF format  and sometimes with a TFW world file. All data use the Geographic coordinate system (projection) [EPSG:4326](https://epsg.io/4326), WGS84 datum `+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +no_defs`.

I am not responsible for any problems relating to accuracy, content, design, and how it is used. If you find an error or omission, please report it for future updates.
